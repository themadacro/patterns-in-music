# Intervals and 12 notes

Western music has 12 semitones in any octave:

```
1   2     3   4     5   6   7     8   9    10    11    12
C  C#/Db  D  D#/Eb  E   F  F#/Gb  G  G#/Ab  A   A#/Bb   B  
```

Scales are usually simplified to 7 tones in any octave

```
1  2   3   4   5   6   7 
C  D   E   F   G   A   B
```

If we look at how these two numbering systems map to each other:

```
C   1   1
D   3   2
E   5   3
F   6   4
G   8   5
A   10  6
B   12  7
```

The most important interval is the fifth.  The fifth note (in this case G) is always 
7 semitones away from the root.   The root and the fifth form the backbone of every 
chord.  

The second most important interval is the third.  The third note (in this case E) is 
4 semitones away from the root, and the third note is 3 semitones away from the fifth.

If you've played minor chords, you know that the minor third (in this case Eb) is 
3 semitones away from the root, and 4 semitones away from the fifth.

Thus, basic chords (both major and minor) are made up of a _major third_ and a _minor
third_, the only difference being which one comes first  (ie, C is major-minor, and
Cm is minor-major)

More complex chords are similarly created by adding more thirds.  The C7 chord is
created by adding a minor third past the G (this is Bb).  The Cmaj7 chord is created
by adding a major third past the G (this is B)

Chords are based on sequences of third intervals.
