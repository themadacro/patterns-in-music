# Intervals and 12 notes

Western music has 12 semitones in any octave:

```
1   2     3   4     5   6   7     8   9    10    11    12
C  C#/Db  D  D#/Eb  E   F  F#/Gb  G  G#/Ab  A   A#/Bb   B  
```

Scales are usually simplified to 7 tones in any octave

```
1  2   3   4   5   6   7 
C  D   E   F   G   A   B
```

If we look at how these two numbering systems map to each other:

```
C   1   1
D   3   2
E   5   3
F   6   4
G   8   5
A   10  6
B   12  7
```

The most important interval is the fifth.  The fifth note (in this case G) is always 
7 semitones away from the root.   The root and the fifth form the backbone of every 
chord.  

The second most important interval is the third.  A _major third_ (in this case E)
is 4 semitones away from the root.  A _minor third_ (in this case Eb) is 3 semitones
away from the root.

But notice that there is an interval between the third and the fifth.  The difference
between E and G is a _minor third_ and Eb and G is a _major third_

Thus, basic chords (both major and minor) are made up of a _major third_ and a _minor
third_, the difference being which one comes first  (ie, C is major-minor, and
Cm is minor-major)

More complex chords are similarly created by adding more thirds.  The C7 chord is
created by adding a minor third past the G (this is Bb).  The C9 chord is created
by adding a fifth on top of the fifth (D)

Chords are based on sequences of third intervals.
