# The minor scale

The minor scale uses the same pattern as the major scale except it starts with A instead of C

```
        i  ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  i
        A  B   C    D   E  F   G    A
```

If we extend the scale as we did before, and map the I, IV, and V chords, we will cover all the notes:

```
       iv  v  vi  vii  i  ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  i   ii  iii
       D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   
```
and
```
       IVm      Im      Vm
       D  - F - A - C - E - G - B
```

Notice how the progression of these thirds is shifted one position to the left from the major chord?
ie, in the sequence of thirds, A is one third to the left of C.  Thus, the minor scale uses the same
patterns as the major scale in every way, except _it's shifted one third to the left_.

The use of the same patterns with a different root is called a _mode_.  So far we've been introduced
to C Major and A Minor, which use the same scale and use the same patterns, but only differ on which
note is the root.
