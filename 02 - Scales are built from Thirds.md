# Every scale is built from the notes in three chords

There are two separate chains within a scale.  Take the scale of C Major

```
        i  ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  i
        C  D   E    F   G  A   B    C
```

The base chord (I) is i-iii-v
The fifth chord (V) is v-vii-ii
The fourth chord (IV) is iv-vi-i


But if we were to extend the scale above in both directions
```
iv v  vi   vii  i  ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  i  ii iii
F  G  A    B    C  D   E    F   G  A   B    C  D  E
```

You'll notice that the I chord is (i-iii-v) and the V chord is (v-vii-ii), all of which are conseucutive thirds.
The fifth of the I chord is the root of the V chord, and everything wraps around.

In the other direction, you'll notice the IV chord is (iv-vi-i) and the I chord is (i-iii-v) and this follows
the same pattern, and we can chain  IV, I, and V together as a long sequence of consecutive thirds

```
IV      I       V
F - A - C - E - G - B - D
```

Note that this touches all the notes of the scale.  

The reason I, IV, and V form the backbone of all chord progressions is because these three chords touch 
every note of the scale, and do it all with pleasant sounding thirds.
