# Every scale is defined by three chords

There are two separate chains within a scale.  Take the scale of the C Major key

```
        i  ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  i
        C  D   E    F   G  A   B    C
```

The base chord (i) is i-iii-v
The fifth chord (v) is v-vii-ii
The fourth chord (iv) is iv-vi-i

You will notice if we extend it in both directions...

```
v  vi   vii  i  ii  iii  iv  v  vi  vii  i  ii iii
G  A    B    C  D   E    F   G  A   B    C  D  E
```

The i and v chord are made up of consecutive thirds, and the 5th of the i chord is the root of the v chord.

Thus, the i, iv, and v chords represent a continuous sequence of thirds

```
IV      I       V
F - A - C - E - G - B - D
```

Notice how this touches all of the notes on the scale.  The reason I, IV, and V form the backbone of all
chord progressions is because these three chords touch every note of the scale, and do it all with pleasant 
sounding thirds.
