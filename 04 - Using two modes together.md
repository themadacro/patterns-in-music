# Using two modes together

We've previously been introduced to the Major mode and the Minor mode, which use the same patterns
to create chords, and work from the same scale.  The only difference between the modes are the root
note.  We also noted the relationship between those two roots (A is a minor third lower than C)

Not only do these two modes share the same notes, but they share the same chords.  For example, 
Dm (D - F - A) is the IV chord of A minor, but the iim chord of C major.

So we have two parallel chord progressions that form the backbone of each mode:

```
                IV     I      V
C Major         F      C      G
A Minor         Dm     Am     Em
```

When we stay within the three sets of chords, it sounds nice enough.  We can switch modes (ie, 
between the sets of chords) and it changes the mood of the sound.  We can change from the same 
chord in either row to the corresponding chord in another row, and it sounds ok, because two
of the notes stay the same, and the third note passes up a second:

```
    F  (F A  _C)  -> Dm (F  A  _D)
    C  (C E  _G)  -> Am (C  E  _A)
    G  (G B  _D)  -> Em (G  B  _E)
```

When composing chord progressions, we can substitute IV, I, or V from major for the IV, I, or V
in the minor key, and it gives a different feel, but still "sounds" right

```
        C  I    C E G
        G  V        G B D
        Dm ii           D F A
```

When we map the minor chords to the major mode, we see they fill in the "iim", "iiim", and "vim" chords
```
     Dm   -  IV in A minor       iim  in C Major
     Em   -   V in A minor      iiim  in C major
     Am   -   I in A minor       vim  in C major
```
And we note that each of these minor chords are a _substitute_ for the major chord.
That's why you can substitute iim for F and it "sounds" ok:

```
       C  I                            C E G
       G  V                                G B D
       Dm ii (as a substitute for IV)          D F A
```

Take a look at chord progressions in popular songs and think about what it sounds like if you 
think of vim as a substitute I chord,  iiim for V, and iim for IV.
